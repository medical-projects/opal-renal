This is a Renal patient management application built using the [OPAL](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) framework.

## What problem does this solve?

Renal ward handover is a prime example of healthcare professions working in isolation; doctors, nurses and dialysis staff all have their own separate handover, creating lists using Microsoft word and distributing print-outs to their colleagues, often needlessly replicating, with a lack of transparency and inter-professional communication decreasing the speed that good clinical decisions can be made and thus impacting patient care.  Our innovation is simple; making sure the entire team is on the same page, literally and metaphorically; an electronic handover form where all three groups can input information and see all, helping them speed up decisions and giving a much more holistic overview of the patient to aid these decisions.
